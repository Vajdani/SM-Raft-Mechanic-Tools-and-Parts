It was big and alive, but not like an animal, more of a robot. Probably won't be able to deliver my fruit crates, but I have to patch up the holes in the ship fast, or I will drown.\n\n Day 4\n Floor is very wet, I should get out of here.\n\n Day 12\nSunshake rations are almost empty. I’ll have to find something to drink. I'm leaving these notes behind, in case there should be any other survivors of the other ships. I set up a base on a nearby island. If you’re lucky, I’m still alive"
