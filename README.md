**Play with everything from Raft Mechanic, but in creative!(no sharks though)**
**Thanks to [Questionable Mark's Modded Craftbot Recipes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2816900681), they're also craftable in survival!**

**Custom loot in survival available via the [Custom Loot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3224128169) mod**

More info about the mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807590049)!

Please leave all suggestions and ideas for Raft Mechanic on the custom game(linked above) instead of this mod.
